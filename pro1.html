      <h2>Christain Matrimonial</h2>
      <p> The first principle that I believe should play a large role in a Christian’s personal
      relationship is trust, without trust the couple’s relationship would crumble. The
      whole relationship must be based on trust.

      
      The second principle I think is tolerance no
      matter how many problems or bad past relationships a person has had the Christian attitude
      is to be nice and have patience with the other person.</p>

      <h2>Marathi Matrimonial</h2>
      <p>Matrimonial sites are popular in India and among Indians settled overseas,
        as an alternative to the traditional marriage broker.[3] According to the
        Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry in India, the online matrimony
        business is expected to be a $250 Million business by 2017.[4] According to
        The New York Times, there are over 1500 matrimony websites in India.[5]
        Matrimonial sites register users, after which they are able to upload their
        profile onto a searchable database maintained by the website.
        

        Those users
        looking to find suitors search the database with customised searches that
        typically include nationality, age, gender, availability of photograph and
        often religion, geographic location and caste (mainly for websites based in India). </p>
